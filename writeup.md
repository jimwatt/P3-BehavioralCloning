# **Behavioral Cloning** 

### Goal:

Use transfer learning to train a model that steers a simple automobile around a track.  The model predicts correct steering angles using images of the road ahead as  input.

**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report
